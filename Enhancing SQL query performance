1. Avoid using SELECT * in queries; instead, specify the appropriate columns.
select <column_name_1>,<Column_name_2> from <table_name>

2. Avoid subqueries; instead, use joins
No:SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())); 
Yes:SELECT DISTINCT c.* FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());

3. Use EXISTS instead of IN: 
No:SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE()));
Yes: SELECT * FROM customers c WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id AND o.order_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE()));
