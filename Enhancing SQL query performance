1. Avoid using SELECT * in queries; instead, specify the appropriate columns.
select <column_name_1>,<Column_name_2> from <table_name>

2. Avoid subqueries; instead, use joins
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())); 
SELECT DISTINCT c.* FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());
